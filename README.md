Used a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Curl] - cURL is a computer software project providing a library and command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols.
* [bash] - command language interpreter

And of course Linux Basic Security Setup v1.2 itself is open source with a public repository on [GitHub](git-repo-url)

### Execution

Script requires [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
[centos]
$ yum install curl

[Debian Linux 10/9/8]
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

Execute the script...

```sh
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhil850/Server_Audit/master/SecureServer.sh | bash
```
